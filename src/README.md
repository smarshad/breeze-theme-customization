# Laravel Authentication & Security Enhancement Project

This repository showcases the process of converting an existing HTML theme into a Laravel application, setting up authentication using Laravel Breeze, and enhancing it with modern security and architectural improvements such as lock screens, two-factor authentication, and a service-layer refactor.

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

- Integrate an existing front-end theme into a fresh Laravel installation.  
- Implement and customize Laravel Breeze authentication views.  
- Extend authentication with:
  - Session-based and database-based **lock screens**  
  - **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** using email OTP  
  - **Service-layer architecture** for cleaner separation of concerns  
- Improve maintainability, scalability, and code readability.

## 🧭 Setup Instructions
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laravel-auth-enhanced.git
cd laravel-auth-enhanced

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Copy environment file and generate key
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Run database migrations
php artisan migrate

# Start the development server
php artisan serve

Day 1-2

    Converted existing HTML theme into a Laravel application.
    Verified layout integration and pushed initial setup to GitHub.

Day 3

    Installed Laravel Breeze authentication scaffolding
    composer require laravel/breeze --dev
    php artisan breeze:install blade
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve
    Tested default Breeze routes and views (login, register, password reset, etc.).

Day 4

    Customized Breeze auth pages with the existing theme design.
    Implemented Lock Screen Feature:
    Added is_locked column in users table.
    Session-based Lock: user manually locks screen; session key is_locked=true.
    Database-based Lock: admin can permanently lock a user.
    Forgot/Reset Password screen pending.

Day 5

    Enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
    Added option in profile for users to enable/disable two_factor_auth.
    Implemented OTP generation and email delivery.

Day 6

    Completed Forgot Password functionality and tested end-to-end.
    Updated LockMiddleware to restrict access when user is locked.
    Applied middleware to protected routes.

Day 7
    
    1 Authentication Refactor & Service Layer Integration
        Refactored authentication flow to follow clean architecture.
        Grouped routes under Auth namespace:
        Route::middleware('guest')->prefix('auth')->group(function () {
            Route::get('login', [LoginController::class, 'showLogin'])->name('login');
            Route::post('login', [LoginController::class, 'login'])->name('auth.login');
        });

    2 AuthController → LoginController
        Moved logic from AuthController into dedicated LoginController.
        Controller now only handles HTTP requests, delegating business logic to LoginService.
        public function login(LoginRequest $request){
            return $this->loginService->handleLogin($request);
        }

        Here, Laravel automatically injects the validated form request (LoginRequest) using Dependency Injection.
        When this method is called, Laravel:
        Creates a new LoginRequest instance.
        Automatically runs its rules() and authorize() methods.
        If validation fails → it redirects back automatically.
        If validation passes → $request->validated() can be safely used.
        So your controller’s role is to receive the validated input and delegate logic to the service

    3 loginService
        public function handleLogin(LoginRequest $request)
        {
            $validated = $request->validated();
            ------------------------
            ------------------------
            ------------------------
        }
        The service layer doesn’t have to validate again; it just uses the already validated data.

        Path: app/Services/Auth/LoginService.php
        Handles all login-related business logic:
        Generates and manages OTPs for users with 2FA.
        Sends OTP via SendOtpMail.
        Redirects user to OTP verification screen.
    
    4  Dependency Injection (DI) Usage

        The `LoginService` uses **constructor-based dependency injection** to receive required classes and services instead of creating them manually.  
        This improves testability, flexibility, and adherence to Clean Architecture principles.

        **Example:**
        ```php
        namespace App\Services\Auth;

        use App\Mail\SendOtpMail;
        use App\Models\User;
        use App\Models\EmailOtp;
        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
        use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;

    5 Configuration Enhancements

        Added OTP expiry setting:
        config/auth.php
        'otp_expiry' => env('OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES', 10),
        .env -- OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10
